# hello-world
First repository for practice
- Hi, Iâ€™m @hannahrasmussen. I studied physics and mathematics in undergrad at the University of San Diego and am currently working as a post-baccalaureate research assistant in Dr. Chad Kishimoto's lab.
- I am interested in cosmology, astrophysics, particle physics, and quantum mechanics. 
- My research focuses on studying the effects of sterile neutrinos on the early Universe (around the epoch of weak decoupling), specifically how the decay of these sterile species would affect N-effective and Big Bang Nucleosynthesis.
- I can be reached at hrasmussen@sandiego.edu.
